# Embedded Systems Programming with C++

This is the code [repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Embedded-Systems-Programming-with-Cxx) for<br>
**Embedded Systems Programming with C++** by [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/)<br>
**Learning from scratch to configure, develop, test and monitor**

## What is this book about?

Build ready-to-go embedded systems and supporting applications using C++, providing modern and easy-to-manage interactive solutions for people's lives!<br>
Embedded Systems Programming with C++ goes through all the steps to create and integrated embedded environments from the scratch, enabling you to design accurate solutions for distinct embedded scenarios with strong C++ code and modern technologies.

The book covers the following exciting features:
* Choose and set up the appropriate device and OS for a project
* Create Yocto, Docker, CMake, Ninja and Conan builds from the scratch
* Write clean, safe, cross-platform and reusable C++ code
* Manipulate data, image and video using SQLite, OpenCV and GStreamer
* Communicate your device to the world via Bluetooth, USB, Ethernet
* Develop Desktop interactive apps for Mac, Windows and Linux
* Manage your IoT fleet through GCP, AWS and Balena
* Continuously monitor, access, and update your devices 

## Instructions and Navigations

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, `Chapter01`.

The code will look like the following:

```
if (test expression)
{
  Statement upon condition is true
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you want to start developing embedded applications in C++, create C++ desktop programs to interact with IoTs, or learn modern approaches regarding cross-platform C++ code, this book is for you. This book is also recommended for experienced C++ embedded engineers who want to get updated with the technology landscape, and for those who want to learn modern ways to manage an IoT device fleet. The reader should be comfortable with C++, object-oriented concepts, and have basic knowledge of hardware, networking, and Linux. No prior knowledge with embedded systems is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-16).
